 century.

110
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,500
 He's just finished

111
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:01,000

00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:03,480
 called,

00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:06,500
 outlines and defines

120
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:07,000
 some of

121
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:07,500
 the

122
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,000
 threats

123
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,500
 to our freedom in

124
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:09,000
 the United

125
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,240
 States.

126
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:11,360
 Mr.

127
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,000
 Huxley,

128
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,500
 right off the bat, let

129
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:12,720
 me ask

130
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:12,880
 you this, as

131
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:13,240
 you

132
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:13,340
 see

133
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:13,480
 it.

134
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,420
 Who

135
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:14,700
 and

136
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:15,000
 what

137
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:15,500
 are

138
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:16,160
 the enemies

139
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:16,500
 of

140
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:17,250
 freedom

141
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:17,500
 here

142
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:18,500
 in

143
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:19,000
 the

144
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:19,240
 United

145
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:19,360
 States?

146
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:20,820
 Well,

147
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:21,000
 I don't

148
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:21,500
 think you can

149
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,000
 say who

150
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,040
 in

151
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:22,540
 the

152
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:22,820
 United

153
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:23,240
 States?

154
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 I

155
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 don't think there are any sinister persons deliberately trying

156
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:27,500
 to

157
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:28,000
 rob

158
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,500
 people of

159
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:28,970
 their

160
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:29,300
 freedom.

161
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,880
 But

162
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:32,380
 I

163
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:33,120
 do

164
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:33,240
 think, first

165
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:33,500
 of all,

166
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,000
 that there are a number of

167
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,980
 impersonal forces which are

168
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:36,500
 pushing

169
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:37,500
 in

170
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:37,600
 the

171
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:37,740
 direction

172
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:38,000
 of

173
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,500
 less

174
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:38,750
 and

175
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:38,940
 less

176
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:39,100
 freedom.

177
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,800
 And

178
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,300
 I also

179
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,480
 think that there

180
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:46,680
 are a number

181
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,380
 of technological

182
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:48,680
 devices

183
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:48,880
 which

184
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:48,900
 anybody

185
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:49,320
 who

186
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:49,380
 wishes

187
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:49,880
 to use can use to accelerate this process of going away from freedom of

188
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:49,900
 imposing

189
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:52,400
 control.

190
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,760
 What are

191
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:53,920
 these

192
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:53,940
 forces

193
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:54,000
 and

194
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,300
 these

195
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,170
 devices, Mr.

196
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:56,670
 Huxley?

197
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,500
 I should

198
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,000
 say

199
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,500
 that there

200
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,240
 are two

201
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:00,300
 main

202
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:01,560
 impersonal

203
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,380
 forces.

204
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 The first of

205
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,210
 them

206
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:07,000
 is not exceedingly important in the United States at the present time, though very important in other

207
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,340
 countries.

208
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,080
 This

209
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:14,500
 is the force

210
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,500
 which

211
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,000
 in general terms can

212
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,500
 be

213
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:16,580
 called

214
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:18,140
 overpopulation,

215
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:18,640
 the

216
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,140
 mounting

217
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:19,640
 pressure

218
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:19,720
 of

219
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:19,940
 population

220
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:20,180
 pressing

221
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:20,420
 upon

222
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:20,640
 existing

223
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,500
 resources.

224
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,420
 And

225
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:22,920
 this,

226
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:23,040
 of

227
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:23,080
 course,

228
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:23,500
 is an

229
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:23,730
 extraordinary

230
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:24,920
 thing.

231
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,430
 Something

232
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:28,750
 is happening,

233
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:29,250
 which has never

234
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:29,280
 happened

235
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,780
 in

236
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:31,660
 the

237
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:31,850
 world's history before. I mean, it's just take a simple fact that between the time of the birth of Christ and the landing of the

238
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:35,880
 Mayflower, the

239
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,380
 population

240
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:36,880
 of the

241
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:36,990
 Earth

242
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:37,890
 doubled.

243
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,680
 It rose

244
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,250
 from 250 million

245
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:39,500
 to

246
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,500
 probably 500

247
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,000
 million.

248
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,500
 Today,

249
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,000
 the

250
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,500
 population

251
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,560
 of the Earth

252
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,060
 is rising at such a rate

253
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,000
 that it will

254
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,250
 double in

255
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:46,850
 half

256
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:46,870
 a

257
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:47,250
 century.

258
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,500
 Well, why should

259
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,000
 overpopulation

260
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,200
 work to

261
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,200
 diminish our

262
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:50,500
 freedoms?

263
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,630
 Well,

264
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:58,130
 in

265
00:02:58,130 --> 00:02:58,510
 a

266
00:02:58,510 --> 00:02:59,030
 number

267
00:02:59,030 --> 00:02:59,630
 of ways, I mean, the experts in the

268
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:00,020
 field, like Harrison

269
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:00,880
 Brown, for example, pointed

270
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,380
 out that in the

271
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:02,330
 underdeveloped countries, actually the standard of living is

272
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:02,500
 present-folding that people have

273
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,000
 less

274
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 to eat and

275
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,500
 less goods

276
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,500
 per

277
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:08,580
 capita

278
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:09,500
 than

279
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:09,820
 they

280
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:09,840
 had

281
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:09,980
 50

282
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:09,990
 years

283
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:10,120
 ago.

284
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,630
 And

285
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:18,630
 as

286
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:18,990
 the position of these countries, the economic position becomes more

287
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:19,130
 and

288
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:19,330
 more

289
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:20,700
 precarious, obviously the central government has to take over more and more responsibility for keeping the ship of

290
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:21,700
 state on

291
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:21,880
 an

292
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:21,930
 even

293
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:21,960
 keel.

294
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,680
 And

295
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,000
 then,

296
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,040
 of

297
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,600
 course,

298
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:30,950
 you're

299
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:31,850
 likely

300
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:31,880
 to get

301
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:32,000
 social

302
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,960
 unrest

303
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:32,980
 under such

304
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:33,460
 conditions

305
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:33,480
 with

306
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:33,980
 again an

307
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:34,500
 intervention

308
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,000
 of

309
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,500
 the

310
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:35,930
 central

311
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:36,040
 government.

312
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,500
 And

313
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:37,880
 so,

314
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,880
 I think one sees

315
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:41,000
 here a

316
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,500
 pattern

317
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,320
 which seems

318
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:42,500
 to

319
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:42,680
 be

320
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:42,780
 pushing

321
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:43,000
 very

322
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,020
 strongly

323
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:43,500
 towards

324
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:43,960
 a

325
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,960
 totalitarian

326
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,860
 regime.

327
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 And

328
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,500
 unfortunately,

329
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,500
 as in

330
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,500
 all these

331
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:55,120
 underdeveloped countries, the only highly organized political party is the Communist Party, it looks rather as though they will be the

332
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:55,500
 heirs

333
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,000
 to this unfortunate process that

334
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,500
 they will step

335
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,500
 into the

336
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,120
 position

337
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:02,720
 of

338
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,300
 power.

339
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,800
 Well,

340
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:04,930
 then

341
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:05,310
 ironically

342
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:09,310
 enough, that

343
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:09,810
 one

344
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:10,810
 of the greatest

345
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:11,090
 forces against communism in the world, the Catholic

346
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:11,380
 Church, according to your

347
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:11,680
 thesis, would seem to be pushing us directly into the hands of the Communists

348
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:11,860
 because they are against birth

349
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:17,460
 control.

350
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,020
 Well,

351
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:18,040
 I

352
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:18,180
 think

353
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:18,540
 this strange

354
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:19,530
 paradox

355
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:19,710
 probably

356
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:20,500
 is

357
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,000
 true.

358
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,750
 There

359
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:27,500
 is

360
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,380
 an extraordinary situation,

361
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:30,500
 actually.

362
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,000
 One

363
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,030
 has

364
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:31,130
 to

365
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:31,460
 look at it, of course, from a biological

366
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:33,960
 point of

367
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:34,960
 view.

368
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,460
 The

369
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:35,840
 whole

370
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:35,860
 essence

371
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:35,960
 of

372
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:36,440
 biological

373
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:36,460
 life

374
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:36,960
 on

375
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:37,120
 Earth

376
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:37,340
 is

377
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:37,360
 a

378
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:37,450
 question

379
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:37,460
 of

380
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:37,960
 balance.

381
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 And

382
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 what

383
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,400
 we

384
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:45,500
 have done is to

385
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,590
 practice death

386
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:48,230
 control in

387
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:48,920
 a most intensive manner without balancing

388
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,320
 this with birth

389
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:49,420
 control at the other

390
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:51,420
 end, consequently the birth rates

391
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:51,920
 remain as high as

392
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:55,420
 they

393
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,420
 were,

394
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:56,920
 and

395
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,120
 death rates

396
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:57,420
 have

397
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:57,670
 fallen

398
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:58,420
 substantially.

399
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,360
 All

400
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,580
 right, then, so much for the time being anyway for overpopulation,

401
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:03,000
 another

402
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,220
 force

403
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,000
 that is diminishing our

404
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 freedoms.

405
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,730
 Well, another

406
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:10,820
 force which

407
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:11,530
 I think is

408
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:12,230
 very strongly

409
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:12,810
 operative

410
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:13,580
 in this country is

411
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:14,080
 the

412
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:14,220
 force of what may be called

413
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,400
 overorganization

414
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:16,550
 as

415
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:16,800
 technology

416
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,480
 becomes

417
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:17,500
 more

418
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:17,760
 and

419
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:17,960
 more

420
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:18,500
 complicated.

421
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 And

422
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,350
 since

423
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:24,360
 the industry

424
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,870
 would have more and more elaborate organizations, more hierarchical organizations, and

425
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:27,870
 incidentally

426
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:28,870
 the advance of technology has been accompanied

427
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:29,870
 by an

428
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:30,370
 advance in the

429
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:30,870
 science of

430
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:31,800
 organization.

431
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,510
 It's

432
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:33,510
 now possible to

433
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:33,610
 make organizations on

434
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:34,680
 a

435
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:34,740
 larger

436
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:34,830
 scale

437
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:35,330
 than was ever

438
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:35,540
 possible

439
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:37,000
 before.

440
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,570
 And

441
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:44,570
 so

442
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:44,910
 that you have more and more people living their

443
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:44,990
 lives

444
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:45,080
 out as

445
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:45,410
 subordinates

446
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:45,770
 in these hierarchical systems controlled by

447
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:46,420
 bureaucracies, either

448
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:48,990
 bureaucracies

449
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:49,230
 of big business or the

450
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:50,490
 bureaucracies

451
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:52,010
 of

452
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:52,020
 big

453
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:52,490
 government.

454
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 Now, the devices

455
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,020
 that you were

456
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:54,180
 talking

457
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:54,990
 about,

458
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:55,060
 are

459
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:55,160
 there

460
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:55,200
 specific

461
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:55,790
 devices

462
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:56,000
 or

463
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,500
 methods

464
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,000
 of

465
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,500
 communication

466
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,000
 which

467
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,160
 diminish

468
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:58,340
 our

469
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:58,480
 freedoms

470
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:58,500
 in

471
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:58,820
 addition

472
00:05:58,820 --> 00:05:58,980
 to

473
00:05:58,980 --> 00:05:59,850
 overpopulation

474
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:01,100
 and

475
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:04,250
 overorganization?

476
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 There

477
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,250
 are

478
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:06,490
 certainly devices which can

479
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:07,490
 be

480
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:08,020
 used in this way.

481
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 I

482
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 mean, let

483
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,410
 us

484
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:14,410
 take

485
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:14,440
 our broad piece of very recent and very painful history

486
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,440
 as

487
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:15,940
 the

488
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:16,440
 propaganda used by

489
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,500
 Hitler,

490
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,000
 which

491
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,380
 was

492
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:18,500
 incredibly

493
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,000
 effective.

494
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,900
 I

495
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:21,310
 mean,

496
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:21,400
 what were Hitler's

497
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:21,500
 methods?

498
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,000
 Hitler

499
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,500
 used Terra on

500
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,000
 the one

501
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,900
 kind,

502
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:24,000
 brute

503
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,080
 force

504
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:24,500
 on

505
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:24,680
 the one

506
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,120
 hand.

507
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,470
 He

508
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:26,920
 also

509
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:34,060
 used a very efficient form of propaganda, which he

510
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,560
 was using every modern device at that time. He

511
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:35,700
 didn't have TV, but he had the radio which he used to

512
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:39,200
 the fullest

513
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,200
 extent.

514
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,310
 And

515
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:41,470
 was

516
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:43,130
 able

517
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:43,550
 to impose

518
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:46,680
 his

519
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,970
 will

520
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:48,590
 on an immense mass

521
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:48,680
 of

522
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:48,880
 people, I

523
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,130
 mean, the Germans were highly

524
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:49,250
 educated people, for

525
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:49,750
 we're aware of all

526
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:53,000
 this, but how do we

527
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,120
 equate Hitler's use of propaganda for the way that propaganda, if you will, is used,

528
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,620
 let us say, here in

529
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:54,650
 the

530
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:54,740
 United

531
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:58,340
 States?

532
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,540
 Are you

533
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:00,080
 suggesting

534
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:00,680
 that

535
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:00,720
 the

536
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,040
 parallel,

537
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:01,100
 not

538
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:01,320
 being

539
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:01,560
 used

540
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,000
 in

541
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,420
 this

542
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:02,980
 way?

543
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,530
 No,

544
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:07,030
 but

545
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:10,030
 the point is it seems

546
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:10,500
 to me

547
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,500
 that there

548
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:11,520
 are methods present available, methods superior

549
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,720
 in

550
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:14,780
 some

551
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:14,880
 respects

552
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,020
 to

553
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:15,400
 Hitler's

554
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:15,520
 method, which could

555
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,020
 be used in

556
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:16,520
 a

557
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:16,660
 bad

558
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:17,020
 situation.

559
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 I

560
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,030
 mean,

561
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:19,500
 what I feel very strongly

562
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:19,800
 is

563
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:19,840
 that

564
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,000
 we

565
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,780
 mustn't

566
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:22,080
 be

567
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:22,280
 caught by

568
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:22,720
 surprise

569
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,360
 by

570
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:23,570
 our own

571
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:24,500
 advancing

572
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,250
 technology.

573
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,420
 It

574
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:29,920
 happened

575
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,420
 to gain

576
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:31,500
 and again in history, with technology

577
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,080
 as

578
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:33,140
 advance,

579
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:34,140
 and this

580
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:34,720
 changes

581
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:34,800
 social condition. And suddenly people have

582
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,800
 found themselves in a situation which they didn't foresee and doing all sorts of things they didn't really want to

583
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,800
 do.

584
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,660
 Well,

585
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:39,780
 now

586
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:39,800
 what

587
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,280
 do you

588
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:40,780
 mean?

589
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:41,280
 Do you mean that we develop our

590
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:41,580
 television,

591
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:41,620
 but

592
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:42,000
 we

593
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,220
 don't

594
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:42,500
 know

595
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,000
 how

596
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,500
 to use it

597
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,060
 correctly?

598
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:44,500
 Is that

599
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,080
 the

600
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:46,340
 point

601
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:46,620
 that you're making?

602
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,500
 The

603
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,000
 television, I think, is being used quite harmlessly. It's being used, I think. I would feel it's being used too much to

604
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:51,500
 distract

605
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,500
 everybody all the

606
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,960
 time.

607
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,500
 But

608
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,880
 I

609
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,960
 mean, imagine, which must be the situation in all communist countries, where the television, where it exists, is always saying the same

610
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,000
 thing, the whole

611
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:01,020
 time, is always

612
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:01,100
 driving

613
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:05,240
 along.

614
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,830
 It's not creating a wide front of distraction. It's

615
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:11,330
 creating a

616
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:12,000
 one-pointed, drumming

617
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,500
 in, with a single idea all the time. It's obviously

618
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,500
 an

619
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:15,640
 immensely

620
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,000
 powerful

621
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,960
 instrument.

622
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:17,010
 So

623
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:17,650
 you're

624
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:18,010
 talking about the

625
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:18,040
 potential

626
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:18,530
 misuse

627
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:18,900
 of the

628
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,960
 instrument.

629
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,060
 Exactly.

630
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:21,270
 We

631
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:21,400
 have,

632
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,520
 after all, technology is

633
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:24,740
 in

634
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:24,880
 itself

635
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,400
 marveled in

636
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:26,500
 useful. These

637
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:26,600
 are just

638
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,420
 powers

639
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:28,000
 which

640
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,460
 can

641
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:28,500
 either be used well

642
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:28,600
 or

643
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,400
 real.

644
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,510
 It's the same thing with atomic energy. We can either use it to

645
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:33,520
 blow ourselves up or we can use it as a substitute for the coal

646
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:36,500
 and the oil which

647
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,040
 we're

648
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:37,240
 running

649
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:37,500
 out.

650
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,330
 You've

651
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:39,330
 even written about

652
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:40,290
 the

653
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:40,460
 use of

654
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:40,960
 drugs in

655
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,280
 this

656
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:41,710
 life.

657
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,240
 Well,

658
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,680
 now this is a

659
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:43,930
 very

660
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:44,080
 interesting

661
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:44,500
 subject.

662
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,000
 In this book,

663
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 if you mention this book of mine, Brave New

664
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 World, I postulated a substance called

665
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,500
 Soma,

666
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,000
 which

667
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,160
 was

668
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:53,250
 a

669
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:53,500
 very

670
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,500
 versatile

671
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,500
 drug.

672
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,980
 It

673
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:00,480
 makes people feel happy in small

674
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:00,500
 doses. It would make them see visions in medium doses and it

675
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,000
 would send

676
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 them to

677
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 sleep in

678
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,500
 large

679
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,800
 doses.

680
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,600
 Well,

681
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:06,780
 I

682
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,280
 don't think

683
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:08,520
 such

684
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:08,700
 a

685
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:08,730
 drug

686
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:09,200
 exists

687
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:09,700
 now. I know it

688
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:10,500
 will

689
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:10,580
 ever exist, but we

690
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:11,080
 do have drugs

691
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:11,500
 which

692
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,000
 will

693
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,500
 do some of

694
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:12,620
 these

695
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:13,250
 things.

696
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,500
 I

697
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,280
 think it's

698
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:15,500
 quite

699
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:19,130
 on the

700
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:19,630
 cards that we

701
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:19,910
 may

702
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:20,080
 have

703
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:20,790
 drugs

704
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:20,810
 which

705
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:20,880
 will

706
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,390
 profoundly

707
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:21,590
 change

708
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:21,710
 our

709
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:22,050
 mental

710
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:22,630
 states without

711
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:23,110
 doing

712
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:23,130
 us any

713
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:23,630
 harm.

714
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,320
 This

715
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:24,840
 is

716
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,340
 the

717
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:26,280
 pharmacological

718
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,000
 revolution

719
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,500
 which has taken place.

720
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,500
 We

721
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:29,910
 have now

722
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:29,920
 powerful

723
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,380
 mind-changing

724
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:31,430
 drugs

725
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:32,000
 which

726
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,100
 physiologically

727
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:33,150
 speaking

728
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:33,500
 are

729
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:33,560
 almost

730
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,480
 costly.

731
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,210
 They are

732
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:40,840
 not like opium

733
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,520
 or

734
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:41,680
 like cocaine which do change the

735
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,180
 state of

736
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:42,680
 mind but

737
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,180
 to

738
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:43,640
 leave

739
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,040
 terrible

740
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:44,180
 results

741
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:44,380
 physiologically

742
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:45,180
 and

743
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:45,500
 morally.

744
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,400
 Mr.

745
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:50,000
 Huxley, in your new

746
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,490
 essays

747
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:50,500
 you

748
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,710
 state

749
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:54,210
 that these various enemies are

750
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:54,710
 pushing us toward

751
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:54,930
 a

752
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:54,950
 real life Brave

753
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:55,210
 New World and

754
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:55,710
 you say that it's

755
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:56,030
 awaiting

756
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:56,210
 us

757
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:56,570
 just

758
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:56,710
 around

759
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:56,960
 the

760
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,210
 corner.

761
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,820
 First

762
00:09:59,820 --> 00:09:59,880
 of

763
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,200
 all, can you

764
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:00,240
 detail

765
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,240
 for us what life

766
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:02,500
 in this Brave New World which

767
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,000
 you fear so much of what

768
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,500
 life might

769
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,500
 be

770
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,630
 like?

771
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,610
 Well,

772
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:09,110
 to

773
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:09,770
 start

774
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:12,000
 with,

775
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 I think

776
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,500
 this kind of the dictatorship of the future, I think we're

777
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,000
 very

778
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 unlike

779
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,500
 the

780
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,740
 dictatorships which

781
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:17,300
 we've

782
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:17,420
 been

783
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:17,480
 familiar

784
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:17,640
 with

785
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:17,740
 in

786
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:17,880
 the

787
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:18,040
 immediate

788
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:18,240
 past.

789
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,500
 I

790
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,000
 mean, take

791
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,420
 another

792
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:22,620
 book

793
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,260
 prophesying the

794
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:24,280
 future

795
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:24,340
 which

796
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:24,840
 was a very

797
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,110
 remarkable

798
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:25,340
 book, George

799
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:27,000
 Orwell's

800
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,630
 1984.

801
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,680
 This

802
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,570
 book was written

803
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:34,640
 at the height

804
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:34,700
 of the study

805
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:34,740
 in East

806
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:34,960
 Rageem and just after the Hitler regime and there

807
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,960
 he

808
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,960
 foresaw a

809
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,400
 dictatorship

810
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:38,460
 using

811
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:38,960
 entirely the

812
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,320
 methods

813
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:39,440
 of

814
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:39,740
 terror,

815
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:39,860
 methods

816
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:39,960
 of

817
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:40,020
 physical

818
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:40,460
 violence.

819
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,600
 Now,

820
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,100
 I think

821
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:42,110
 what is

822
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:45,630
 going to

823
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:45,830
 happen in the future is that

824
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:46,460
 dictators will find, as the old saying goes, that you can do everything with bear and it's except sit

825
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:46,590
 on

826
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:50,350
 them.

827
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,540
 But

828
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:54,540
 if

829
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:57,420
 you

830
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:57,840
 want

831
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,060
 to preserve

832
00:10:59,060 --> 00:10:59,420
 your power indefinitely, you have to get the consent

833
00:10:59,420 --> 00:10:59,810
 of the rule

834
00:10:59,810 --> 00:10:59,840
 and this they will do

835
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,460
 part

836
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:00,830
 of

837
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:04,870
 by

838
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:05,230
 drugs

839
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:05,390
 as

840
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:05,620
 I

841
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:05,650
 also

842
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:05,930
 in

843
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:06,370
 Brave

844
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:06,750
 New

845
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:06,850
 World,

846
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:06,870
 part

847
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:07,030
 of

848
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:07,370
 these

849
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:07,870
 new

850
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:08,370
 techniques

851
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:08,870
 of

852
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:09,370
 propaganda.

853
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,920
 They will

854
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,040
 do it by bypassing the

855
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:14,120
 rational side

856
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,030
 of man

857
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:15,500
 and appealing to his subconscious and his deeper

858
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,960
 emotions

859
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,000
 and

860
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,500
 his physiology

861
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,500
 even.

862
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 And

863
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:23,090
 so

864
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:23,420
 making

865
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:23,790
 him

866
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:23,880
 actually

867
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:24,170
 love

868
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:24,570
 his

869
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:25,500
 slavery.

870
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:25,750
 I

871
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:26,500
 mean,

872
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:26,980
 I

873
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:27,060
 think

874
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:27,500
 this

875
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:27,620
 is

876
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,010
 the

877
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:29,160
 danger

878
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:29,500
 that

879
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:29,940
 actually

880
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:30,000
 people

881
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,100
 may

882
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:30,380
 be

883
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:30,500
 in

884
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:30,700
 some

885
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:30,730
 ways

886
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:31,500
 happy

887
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:31,620
 under

888
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:32,000
 the

889
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,400
 new

890
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:32,660
 regime.

891
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:33,550
 But they

892
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:36,550
 will

893
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:37,900
 be happy in

894
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:38,980
 situation where they open to be

895
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:39,180
 happy. But let

896
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:39,430
 me

897
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:39,930
 ask

898
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:41,430
 you this.

899
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:41,630
 You're talking

900
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:41,930
 about a world that

901
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:42,430
 could take place within the

902
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:43,430
 confines of a totalitarian

903
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:44,680
 state.

904
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 Let's become more

905
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,650
 immediate, more urgent about it. We believe anyway

906
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:49,150
 that

907
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:49,650
 we live in

908
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:50,150
 democracy

909
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:50,250
 here

910
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:51,500
 in

911
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:51,960
 the

912
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,000
 United

913
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,020
 States.

914
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:53,120
 Do

915
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:53,240
 you

916
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,000
 believe that this Brave New World

917
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:55,500
 that you

918
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:55,900
 talk

919
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:56,000
 about

920
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,500
 could,

921
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:57,750
 let's

922
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:58,250
 say

923
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,000
 in

924
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,500
 the

925
00:11:59,500 --> 00:11:59,990
 next

926
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:00,420
 quarter

927
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:00,490
 century,

928
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:00,990
 the

929
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:01,490
 next century.

930
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,920
 Could

931
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,920
 come

932
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,040
 here

933
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:09,500
 to our show us. I

934
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,000
 think it could. I mean, that's why

935
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,500
 I feel

936
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,000
 it's so extremely important here and now to start thinking about these problems, not to let ourselves be taken by

937
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 surprise

938
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,500
 by the

939
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,000
 new

940
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,500
 advances

941
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,000
 in

942
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 technology.

943
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,920
 I

944
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:28,420
 mean,

945
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:30,920
 the example in regard to the use of the drugs,

946
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:31,420
 we know

947
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:32,020
 there's enough evidence now for us to

948
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:32,400
 be able on the basis

949
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,900
 of this evidence and using a certain amount of creative imagination to foresee the kind of uses which could be made by people of bad will with these things and to attempt to to

950
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:41,400
 forestall

951
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,400
 this.

952
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,080
 And

953
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:46,580
 in the same

954
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:47,080
 way,

955
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,080
 I think with

956
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:48,580
 these other

957
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:49,500
 methods of

958
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,000
 propaganda, we can foresee and we can do a good deal to

959
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 forestall.

960
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,500
 I mean,

961
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,000
 after the price of freedom

962
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:53,500
 is eternal

963
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,400
 vigilance.

964
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:56,520
 You

965
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:56,590
 write in enemies

966
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:57,020
 of

967
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,000
 freedom.

968
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:58,020
 You

969
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:58,180
 write

970
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:58,500
 specifically

971
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,000
 about the

972
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 United

973
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,500
 States.

974
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,500
 You say this,

975
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,000
 writing about American

976
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:02,500
 political

977
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,360
 campaigns.

978
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,090
 You

979
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:07,590
 say all

980
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:09,590
 that is needed is money and

981
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:10,030
 the candidate who can be coached to look

982
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:10,670
 sincere

983
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:13,300
 political

984
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:13,400
 principles

985
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:13,440
 and plans for specific action have

986
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,440
 come to lose most

987
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:14,940
 of

988
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:15,440
 their

989
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:15,940
 importance.

990
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 The

991
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:17,020
 personality

992
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:17,250
 of

993
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:17,260
 the

994
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:17,900
 candidate,

995
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:17,940
 the

996
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:18,160
 way

997
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:18,320
 he

998
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:18,370
 is

999
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:18,430
 projected

1000
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:19,000
 by

1001
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:19,520
 the

1002
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:19,600
 advertising

1003
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,000
 experts,

1004
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:20,500
 other

1005
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,000
 things

1006
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:21,500
 that

1007
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:21,960
 really

1008
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,000
 matter.

1009
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,750
 Well,

1010
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,750
 this

1011
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:29,610
 is

1012
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:29,750
 during

1013
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:30,750
 the

1014
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:33,240
 last campaign, there

1015
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:33,990
 was a great deal

1016
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:35,440
 of this

1017
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:35,500
 kind

1018
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,000
 of statement by the advertising managers of the campaign parties. This idea that the candidates had to be merchandise

1019
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:36,500
 as though they

1020
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:40,000
 were so

1021
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,500
 poor

1022
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,360
 toothpaste

1023
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:41,500
 and that

1024
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,000
 you had to depend entirely

1025
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,500
 on

1026
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,000
 the

1027
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,990
 personality.

1028
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:44,920
 I

1029
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:50,420
 mean, the

1030
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:51,050
 personality is

1031
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:51,420
 important, but there

1032
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:51,500
 are certainly people with an extremely

1033
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:51,700
 amiable personality, particularly on

1034
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:54,700
 TV, who might

1035
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:55,200
 not necessarily

1036
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:55,700
 be

1037
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:55,880
 very

1038
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:56,200
 good

1039
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:56,700
 in

1040
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:56,710
 political

1041
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:57,200
 positions

1042
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:57,700
 of

1043
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:57,940
 political

1044
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:58,200
 trust.

1045
00:13:59,000 --> 00:13:59,250
 What do

1046
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:02,250
 you

1047
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:02,750
 feel

1048
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:02,800
 of men like

1049
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:02,940
 Eisenhower, Stevenson, Nixon, with knowledge of

1050
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:03,440
 thought, were trying to pull the world over the eyes of the American

1051
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:07,480
 public?

1052
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,750
 No,

1053
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:12,000
 but

1054
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,500
 they

1055
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,000
 were

1056
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 being

1057
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:15,340
 advised

1058
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:15,740
 by

1059
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:15,760
 powerful advertising

1060
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,420
 agencies who were making

1061
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:16,920
 campaigns of

1062
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:17,420
 a

1063
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:17,920
 quite

1064
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:18,170
 different

1065
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:18,360
 kind

1066
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:18,420
 from what

1067
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:18,920
 had

1068
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:19,170
 been

1069
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:19,420
 made

1070
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:19,670
 before.

1071
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:20,860
 And

1072
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:21,360
 I think

1073
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:21,860
 we should

1074
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:22,360
 see

1075
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:22,410
 probably

1076
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:22,540
 all kinds

1077
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:23,000
 of

1078
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,140
 new devices

1079
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:25,000
 coming

1080
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:25,500
 into

1081
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,000
 the

1082
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,120
 picture.

1083
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:29,500
 For

1084
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:35,450
 example,

1085
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:35,950
 this

1086
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:37,450
 thing which got a

1087
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:37,800
 good

1088
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:37,910
 deal

1089
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:38,450
 of publicity

1090
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:39,600
 last

1091
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,100
 autumn, subliminal

1092
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,500
 projection. I mean, as it stands, this thing I think is of no menace

1093
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,000
 at the moment, but I was talking the other day to one of the people who has done most experimental work in the psychological laboratory

1094
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 with this, who were saying precisely

1095
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:44,500
 this, that it is not at the

1096
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,000
 moment of

1097
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 danger.

1098
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:54,980
 But

1099
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:57,980
 once you've established

1100
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,000
 a principle that something

1101
00:14:59,000 --> 00:14:59,500
 works, you

1102
00:14:59,500 --> 00:14:59,860
 can be absolutely

1103
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:00,000
 sure that

1104
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 the

1105
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,280
 technology

1106
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:01,500
 of it is going to improve

1107
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,250
 steadily.

1108
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 And

1109
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,180
 I

1110
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:07,590
 mean, his view of

1111
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:07,670
 the subject was

1112
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:08,090
 that, well, maybe they will use it

1113
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:10,000
 to

1114
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:10,200
 some

1115
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,000
 extent

1116
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:11,500
 in the 1960

1117
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,000
 campaign, but they will probably use it a good deal and

1118
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:12,500
 much more effectively in the 1964 campaign, because this is

1119
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,000
 the kind of rate at which

1120
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 technology

1121
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,140
 advances.

1122
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:19,510
 And

1123
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:19,910
 we'll be

1124
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:20,010
 persuaded to vote for a

1125
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:21,450
 candidate that we do not know that we are being persuaded to vote

1126
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:23,780
 for.

1127
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,300
 Exactly.

1128
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,000
 I mean, this

1129
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:26,800
 is the rather alarming each of this.

1130
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,160
 You're being

1131
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:27,300
 persuaded

1132
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:27,800
 below

1133
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:27,970
 the

1134
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:28,060
 level

1135
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:28,300
 of

1136
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:28,400
 choice

1137
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:28,600
 and

1138
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,270
 reason.

1139
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,840
 In

1140
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,720
 regard

1141
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,340
 to

1142
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:35,780
 advertising,

1143
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:36,280
 which you

1144
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:36,320
 mentioned just

1145
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:36,620
 a

1146
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:36,750
 little

1147
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:36,780
 ago,

1148
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:37,150
 in

1149
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:37,750
 your

1150
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:37,880
 writing, particularly in enemies of

1151
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:38,380
 freedom, you attack

1152
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,380
 Madison

1153
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:39,800
 Avenue,

1154
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:39,880
 which

1155
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:40,040
 controls

1156
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:40,140
 most

1157
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:40,240
 of

1158
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:40,260
 our

1159
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:40,380
 television

1160
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:40,680
 and

1161
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:41,000
 radio

1162
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:41,500
 advertising,

1163
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,000
 newspaper

1164
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,500
 advertising

1165
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:42,750
 and so

1166
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:43,500
 forth.

1167
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:44,600
 Why

1168
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,680
 do

1169
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,680
 you

1170
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:49,680
 consistently

1171
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,140
 attack the advertising agency?

1172
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:50,960
 Well, no, I think that the

1173
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,940
 British

1174
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:52,840
 players

1175
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:52,960
 are very necessary to

1176
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:53,460
 row,

1177
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:53,710
 but

1178
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:53,960
 the

1179
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:54,260
 danger

1180
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:54,340
 seems

1181
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:54,440
 to

1182
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:54,460
 me in

1183
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:54,880
 a

1184
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:54,960
 democracy

1185
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:55,260
 is

1186
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:55,460
 this.

1187
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,030
 I

1188
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:58,030
 mean, what does

1189
00:15:58,030 --> 00:15:58,100
 a

1190
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,600
 democracy depend

1191
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,420
 on?

1192
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:01,500
 A

1193
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,000
 democracy

1194
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:02,080
 depends

1195
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:02,540
 on

1196
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:02,640
 the

1197
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,000
 individual

1198
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:03,140
 voter

1199
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:03,320
 making

1200
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:03,500
 an intelligent and rational choice for

1201
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,000
 what he regards as his enlightened

1202
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,300
 self-interest

1203
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:05,500
 in

1204
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,500
 any

1205
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,000
 given

1206
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 circumstance.

1207
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,610
 What

1208
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:13,470
 these

1209
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:14,950
 people

1210
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:15,110
 are

1211
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:17,110
 doing,

1212
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:17,220
 I

1213
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:17,250
 mean, what both, but

1214
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:17,500
 their

1215
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,000
 particular purposes

1216
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,970
 are

1217
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:19,000
 selling goods

1218
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:19,500
 and

1219
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,000
 the

1220
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:20,750
 dictatorial

1221
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:21,000
 propaganda

1222
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:21,500
 is

1223
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,000
 to

1224
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:22,020
 try

1225
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:22,140
 to

1226
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:22,250
 bypass

1227
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:22,580
 the

1228
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:22,750
 rational

1229
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:22,990
 side

1230
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:23,000
 of

1231
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:23,300
 men

1232
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:23,500
 and

1233
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:23,540
 to

1234
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:23,650
 appeal

1235
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:23,780
 directly

1236
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:24,060
 to

1237
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:24,420
 these

1238
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:24,500
 unconscious

1239
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:24,800
 forces

1240
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:24,920
 below

1241
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:25,020
 the

1242
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:25,200
 surface.

1243
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:26,290
 So that you are

1244
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:26,580
 in

1245
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:27,100
 a

1246
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,500
 way

1247
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,020
 making

1248
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:29,520
 nonsense

1249
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,500
 of

1250
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:30,920
 the

1251
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:30,940
 whole democratic

1252
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:31,000
 procedure, which

1253
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:31,500
 is based on

1254
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:31,880
 conscious

1255
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:32,120
 choice

1256
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:32,500
 of

1257
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,230
 rational

1258
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:34,000
 ground.

1259
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:35,700
 Of

1260
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:39,000
 course, well, maybe

1261
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:39,700
 you have just answered this next question because in your

1262
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,000
 essay, you

1263
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:41,500
 write about

1264
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:41,900
 television

1265
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,000
 commercials, not

1266
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:43,500
 just

1267
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,000
 political

1268
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:44,780
 commercials,

1269
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:45,000
 but

1270
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:45,200
 television

1271
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:45,500
 commercials

1272
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:45,600
 as

1273
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,000
 such.

1274
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,530
 And

1275
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:49,030
 how has

1276
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:49,360
 you put

1277
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:49,440
 it

1278
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:49,700
 today's children

1279
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:50,040
 walk around singing beer commercials and

1280
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,560
 tooth-faced commercials? And then you link this phenomenon in some way with

1281
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,560
 the dangers of

1282
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,120
 a

1283
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:56,250
 dictatorship.

1284
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:57,680
 Now, could you spell out

1285
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,360
 the

1286
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:58,600
 connection

1287
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,000
 or how

1288
00:16:59,000 --> 00:16:59,380
 do you

1289
00:16:59,380 --> 00:16:59,400
 feel

1290
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,000
 that

1291
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:00,040
 you

1292
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:00,330
 have

1293
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:00,650
 done so sufficiently?

1294
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 Well, I mean,

1295
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:05,360
 yeah, this

1296
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,000
 whole

1297
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:06,800
 question of children, I think,

1298
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,200
 is a terribly

1299
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:07,300
 important one because children are quite clearly much more suggestible

1300
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:07,800
 than

1301
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:08,800
 the

1302
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,020
 average

1303
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:09,920
 grown-up.

1304
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 And

1305
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,500
 again, suppose

1306
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,000
 that for one reason or another,

1307
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:15,500
 all the

1308
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,220
 propaganda was

1309
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:17,000
 in

1310
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:17,500
 the hands of one or

1311
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:17,540
 very

1312
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:20,240
 few

1313
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,240
 agencies.

1314
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:22,270
 You

1315
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:25,520
 would have an extraordinarily powerful

1316
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:25,730
 force playing

1317
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:26,130
 on these children, who

1318
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:26,210
 are probably going

1319
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:26,550
 to

1320
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:27,070
 grow up and be

1321
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:27,810
 adults

1322
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:29,230
 quite

1323
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:30,230
 soon.

1324
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,500
 I

1325
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,000
 do think that this

1326
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:35,420
 is

1327
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:35,500
 not

1328
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:35,730
 an immediate

1329
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:35,960
 threat, but

1330
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:36,460
 it remains a

1331
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:36,860
 possible

1332
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:37,470
 threat.

1333
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:38,500
 And you

1334
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,820
 said

1335
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:41,000
 something to the effect in your essay that the children of

1336
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:41,480
 Europe used to be called cannon

1337
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,000
 fodder,

1338
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:43,500
 and

1339
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,000
 here in the United States they

1340
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:44,500
 are television and radio

1341
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,100
 fodder.

1342
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:47,580
 Well,

1343
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,580
 after all

1344
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:50,580
 the

1345
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:52,650
 interview, you can

1346
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:52,730
 read

1347
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:53,000
 in the trade journal the most political accounts of how

1348
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:53,500
 necessary

1349
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,000
 it is to get hold

1350
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:55,500
 of the children because then they will be loyal brand

1351
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,000
 buyers

1352
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:56,500
 later

1353
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:59,000
 on.

1354
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,540
 But

1355
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:02,040
 I

1356
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,620
 mean, again, you've

1357
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:03,760
 just translated

1358
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,160
 this into political terms. The dictator says they will be loyal ideology buyers when they're

1359
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:09,490
 grown-up.

1360
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:10,390
 We

1361
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:10,560
 hear

1362
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:10,920
 so

1363
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:13,920
 much about brainwashing

1364
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,420
 as

1365
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:15,920
 used by

1366
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,010
 the communists. Do you see any

1367
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:16,090
 brainwashing other than that, which we've just been talking about, that is used here in the United States? Are

1368
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:16,100
 the

1369
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:16,260
 forms of

1370
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:21,880
 brainwashing?

1371
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,320
 Not in

1372
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:24,460
 the

1373
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:24,500
 form that has

1374
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:24,560
 been

1375
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:24,880
 used

1376
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,060
 in China and

1377
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:25,200
 in

1378
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:25,500
 Russia,

1379
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,000
 because

1380
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,500
 this

1381
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,000
 is essentially

1382
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:27,020
 the

1383
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:27,080
 application

1384
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:27,500
 of

1385
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,000
 propaganda

1386
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:28,080
 methods

1387
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:28,500
 must

1388
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,500
 burn

1389
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,500
 and kind

1390
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,000
 of

1391
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 individuals.

1392
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:40,490
 It's

1393
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:41,960
 not a shotgun

1394
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:42,150
 method like

1395
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:42,650
 the

1396
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:43,150
 advertising

1397
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:43,650
 method.

1398
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:44,150
 It's a way of getting hold of the person and playing both on his physiology and his psychology, it really breaks

1399
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:45,030
 down and then you can implant a new idea in

1400
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:45,130
 his

1401
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:49,250
 head.

1402
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:50,090
 I

1403
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:50,510
 mean,

1404
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:52,000
 the descriptions

1405
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:52,780
 of the methods are

1406
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:53,220
 really

1407
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:53,270
 blood

1408
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:53,780
 curdling when

1409
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:54,360
 you

1410
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:54,400
 read

1411
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:54,420
 them.

1412
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 Not

1413
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 only the methods applied to

1414
00:18:59,000 --> 00:18:59,490
 political

1415
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:00,000
 prisoners, but

1416
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,450
 the methods

1417
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:01,000
 applied, for example,

1418
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:01,500
 to the training of the young

1419
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:01,980
 communist administrators and

1420
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:02,980
 missionaries.

1421
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,880
 They

1422
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:06,890
 receive

1423
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:08,760
 an

1424
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:08,880
 incredibly

1425
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,320
 tough

1426
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:09,330
 kind of training, which may cause about

1427
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:11,950
 25% of them to break down or commit suicide, but produces 75% of completely

1428
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:12,230
 one-pointed

1429
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:17,230
 phonetics.

1430
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:18,530
 The

1431
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:21,530
 question, of

1432
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:23,530
 course, that keeps

1433
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:23,920
 coming back to my

1434
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:24,000
 mind is this. Obviously, politics in themselves are

1435
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,500
 not

1436
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,000
 evil.

1437
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:27,500
 Television

1438
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:27,620
 is

1439
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:27,750
 not

1440
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:28,000
 in

1441
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:28,020
 itself

1442
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:28,480
 evil.

1443
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:28,820
 Atomic energy

1444
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:29,220
 is

1445
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:29,480
 not

1446
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:29,510
 evil.

1447
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,520
 And yet you seem

1448
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,140
 to fear that it will be

1449
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:33,960
 used

1450
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:34,320
 in an evil way.

1451
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:34,820
 Why

1452
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:34,980
 is it

1453
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:35,000
 that the right people will not, in

1454
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:35,180
 your

1455
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:35,240
 estimation,

1456
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,240
 use

1457
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,240
 them?

1458
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:39,420
 Why

1459
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:39,840
 is

1460
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:39,910
 it

1461
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:40,190
 that the wrong

1462
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:40,990
 people

1463
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:41,180
 will

1464
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:41,480
 use

1465
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:41,750
 these

1466
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:42,280
 various

1467
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:42,780
 devices

1468
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:43,500
 and

1469
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,000
 for

1470
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:44,240
 the

1471
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:44,640
 wrong

1472
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,000
 motives?

1473
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 Well,

1474
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,500
 I

1475
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,100
 think one of the

1476
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:53,600
 reasons is that these are all instruments

1477
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,100
 for obtaining

1478
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,100
 power. And obviously, the passion for power is one of the most moving passions that exist in

1479
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:59,100
 man.

1480
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,980
 And

1481
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:01,480
 I

1482
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:01,980
 draw this as

1483
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:02,480
 all

1484
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:02,560
 democracies are

1485
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:02,810
 based on

1486
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:03,500
 the

1487
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:07,060
 proposition that power is very dangerous, and that it's

1488
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:07,560
 extremely important not to let any one man or any one small group have

1489
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:07,620
 too

1490
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:08,180
 much

1491
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:08,280
 power

1492
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:08,480
 for

1493
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,500
 too

1494
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:10,720
 long

1495
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:10,880
 a

1496
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,960
 time.

1497
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 And then, what

1498
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 are the British and American

1499
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,040
 constitutions except devices

1500
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:19,380
 for limiting

1501
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:21,840
 power? And all these new devices are extremely efficient instruments for the imposition

1502
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,500
 of power by small groups of a larger

1503
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:28,000
 message.

1504
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 Well,

1505
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,500
 you

1506
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:39,860
 ask

1507
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:40,620
 this

1508
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:40,660
 question

1509
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:41,920
 yourself. In enemies of freedom, I'll put your own question back to you. You ask this. In an age of accelerating

1510
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,620
 overpopulation, of accelerating

1511
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:46,240
 overorganization, and ever more efficient means of mass communication, how can we preserve the integrity

1512
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,130
 and reassert

1513
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:54,990
 the

1514
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:55,230
 value

1515
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:55,240
 of

1516
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:55,660
 the

1517
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:55,720
 human

1518
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:56,240
 individual?

1519
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:57,460
 You put the

1520
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:57,710
 question.

1521
00:20:57,710 --> 00:20:58,210
 Now, here's your chance

1522
00:20:58,210 --> 00:20:58,260
 to

1523
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:59,420
 answer it, Mr.

1524
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:01,850
 Huxen.

1525
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,920
 Well, this

1526
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:07,200
 is

1527
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:07,480
 obviously,

1528
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:07,500
 first of all, it's a

1529
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:07,900
 question of

1530
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:08,400
 education. I

1531
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:08,480
 think

1532
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:08,900
 it's

1533
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:09,900
 terribly important

1534
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:10,400
 to

1535
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:10,480
 insist

1536
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:10,820
 on

1537
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:10,900
 individual

1538
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:11,400
 values.

1539
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:12,490
 I

1540
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:15,750
 mean,

1541
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:17,250
 what

1542
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:18,180
 is

1543
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:18,640
 there is a

1544
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,710
 tendency as you've

1545
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:21,970
 probably read a book

1546
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:22,000
 by

1547
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:22,020
 White, the

1548
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:22,520
 organization

1549
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:25,020
 man, a very interesting, valuable

1550
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,020
 book, I

1551
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:26,500
 think, where

1552
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,500
 he

1553
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:27,560
 speaks

1554
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,000
 about the

1555
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:28,020
 new

1556
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:28,300
 type

1557
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:28,400
 of group

1558
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,100
 morality,

1559
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:29,140
 group

1560
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:29,540
 ethic,

1561
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:29,750
 which

1562
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:30,000
 speaks

1563
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:30,500
 about

1564
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:30,520
 the

1565
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:30,550
 group

1566
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:30,750
 as

1567
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:30,800
 though

1568
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:30,900
 the

1569
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:31,000
 group

1570
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:31,060
 was

1571
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:31,140
 somehow

1572
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:31,250
 more

1573
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:31,500
 important

1574
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:31,750
 than

1575
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:31,780
 the

1576
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:32,000
 individual.

1577
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:33,540
 But

1578
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:36,540
 this

1579
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:37,170
 seems

1580
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:37,550
 as far as

1581
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:38,100
 I'm concerned to be

1582
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,180
 in

1583
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:39,680
 contradiction

1584
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,180
 with what

1585
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:40,680
 we know about the

1586
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,180
 genetical makeup of

1587
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:41,560
 human

1588
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:41,700
 beings,

1589
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:41,840
 that

1590
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:41,900
 every

1591
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:41,960
 human

1592
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:42,120
 being

1593
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:42,140
 is

1594
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:42,680
 unique.

1595
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,860
 And

1596
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:46,160
 it is, of

1597
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:46,300
 course,

1598
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:46,480
 on

1599
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:46,980
 this

1600
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:47,080
 genetic

1601
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:47,530
 basis

1602
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:47,700
 that

1603
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:47,740
 the

1604
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:47,780
 whole

1605
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:47,800
 idea

1606
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,220
 of

1607
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:48,300
 the

1608
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:48,320
 value

1609
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:48,680
 of

1610
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:48,800
 freedom

1611
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:49,000
 is

1612
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:49,500
 based.

1613
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 And

1614
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 I

1615
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:57,100
 think

1616
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,500
 it's

1617
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,000
 extremely

1618
00:21:59,000 --> 00:21:59,650
 important for us to stress this in all our educational life. And I would say it's also very

1619
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:02,150
 important to teach people to be on their guard against the sort of verbal

1620
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:02,700
 booby traps into which they're always being laid

1621
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:05,200
 to analyze the kind of

1622
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,200
 things that

1623
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:08,580
 are said

1624
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:08,700
 to

1625
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:09,200
 them.

1626
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:10,920
 But I think

1627
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:13,920
 there is this

1628
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:14,000
 whole

1629
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:14,480
 educational

1630
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:14,500
 side, and I think there are many more things that one could do to strengthen

1631
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:14,640
 people and to make them

1632
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,000
 more

1633
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 aware of

1634
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:18,020
 what was being

1635
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:19,960
 done.

1636
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,840
 You're a prophet of

1637
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,820
 decentralization.

1638
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,530
 Well,

1639
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:29,530
 yes,

1640
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:30,830
 if this is feasible, it's one of the tragedies it seems

1641
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:31,800
 to me. I mean, many people have been talking

1642
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:32,000
 about the importance of decentralization in order to give back to the voter

1643
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:37,380
 a

1644
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:37,500
 sense

1645
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,000
 of

1646
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:38,500
 direct

1647
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,620
 power.

1648
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:40,580
 The

1649
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:40,620
 voter

1650
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:43,580
 in

1651
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:46,390
 an enormous

1652
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:46,740
 electorate

1653
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:46,960
 feels quite impotent, and his vote

1654
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:47,300
 seems to count

1655
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:47,380
 for

1656
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:49,380
 nothing. This

1657
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:49,800
 is not true where the electorate

1658
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:50,380
 is small and where

1659
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:50,880
 he is dealing

1660
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,380
 with

1661
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:51,880
 a

1662
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:52,040
 group

1663
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:52,380
 which

1664
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:52,840
 he

1665
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:52,860
 can

1666
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:52,880
 manage and

1667
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,380
 understand.

1668
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:54,560
 And if

1669
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,090
 one

1670
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:56,380
 can, as Jefferson after all

1671
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:57,400
 suggested,

1672
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:57,440
 break

1673
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,000
 up the

1674
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 units into

1675
00:22:59,000 --> 00:22:59,010
 smaller and

1676
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:02,130
 smaller

1677
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:03,000
 units.

1678
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:04,040
 So

1679
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:04,750
 get

1680
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,280
 a real

1681
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:09,310
 self-governing democracy. Well,

1682
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:09,560
 that

1683
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,460
 was all

1684
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:11,560
 very

1685
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:11,860
 well

1686
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:12,060
 in

1687
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:12,260
 Jefferson's

1688
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:12,540
 day,

1689
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:12,560
 but

1690
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:12,580
 how

1691
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:12,720
 can

1692
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:12,940
 we

1693
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:13,380
 revamp our

1694
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:13,540
 economic

1695
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:13,560
 system and

1696
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,120
 decentralize?

1697
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:15,880
 And

1698
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:16,380
 at

1699
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:16,390
 the

1700
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:17,000
 same

1701
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:17,500
 time,

1702
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,000
 meet

1703
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:18,840
 militarily and economically the tough challenge

1704
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:19,000
 of

1705
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:19,060
 a

1706
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:19,120
 country

1707
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:19,340
 like Soviet

1708
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:22,440
 Russia.

1709
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 Well,

1710
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 I

1711
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:30,100
 think

1712
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:31,000
 the answer

1713
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:31,330
 to that

1714
00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:31,500
 is that there are, it seems to me that you are the production, industrial production is of two kinds. I mean, there are some kinds of industrial production, which obviously need the most tremendously high centralization, like the making of

1715
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:31,750
 autumn of

1716
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:34,300
 meals, for

1717
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:38,360
 example.

1718
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:39,610
 But

1719
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:44,610
 there

1720
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:45,770
 are

1721
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:46,060
 many other

1722
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:49,080
 kinds

1723
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,920
 where you could decentralize

1724
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:51,000
 quite

1725
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:51,410
 easily

1726
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:51,850
 and probably quite economically, and that you would then have this kind of decentralized life. I thought

1727
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:52,910
 you begin to see it now if you can travel through the south, this decentralized

1728
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:53,910
 textile

1729
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:55,410
 industry, which is bringing up

1730
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:59,410
 there.

1731
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,750
 Mr.

1732
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:01,770
 Huxel,

1733
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:02,250
 let

1734
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:02,500
 me ask you

1735
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:02,780
 this.

1736
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:03,500
 Quite

1737
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:04,500
 seriously.

1738
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:05,000
 Is

1739
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:05,500
 freedom

1740
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,000
 necessary?

1741
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:07,440
 As

1742
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,500
 far as I am concerned,

1743
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:09,000
 it

1744
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:09,760
 is.

1745
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,500
 Yes.

1746
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:10,600
 Is

1747
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,260
 it

1748
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:11,540
 necessary

1749
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:11,820
 for

1750
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:11,860
 a

1751
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:12,190
 productive

1752
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:13,320
 society?

1753
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,640
 Yes, I would say it is. I

1754
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,500
 mean,

1755
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:18,540
 genuinely

1756
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:18,560
 productive

1757
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:18,620
 is

1758
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:19,260
 that.

1759
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:19,300
 I

1760
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:19,940
 mean, I think

1761
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:20,000
 you could

1762
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:20,140
 produce

1763
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:20,190
 plenty

1764
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:20,500
 of goods without

1765
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,060
 much

1766
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:21,440
 freedom.

1767
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:22,130
 But

1768
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:22,290
 I

1769
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:22,850
 think the whole

1770
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:23,250
 sort

1771
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:25,740
 of creative

1772
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:26,000
 life of man

1773
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 is

1774
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:27,500
 ultimately impossible without

1775
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:27,520
 a

1776
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:27,610
 considerable

1777
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:27,750
 measure

1778
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:28,000
 of

1779
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:28,150
 individual

1780
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:28,500
 freedom

1781
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,000
 of

1782
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:29,980
 initiative,

1783
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:30,480
 creation,

1784
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:30,500
 all

1785
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:31,000
 these

1786
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:31,240
 things which we

1787
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:35,240
 value.

1788
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:36,500
 And

1789
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:37,000
 I

1790
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:37,210
 think

1791
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:37,420
 that

1792
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:38,690
 you,

1793
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:39,500
 properly,

1794
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:40,000
 are

1795
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:40,380
 impossible

1796
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:40,500
 without

1797
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:40,740
 a

1798
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:40,980
 large

1799
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:41,400
 measure

1800
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:41,440
 of

1801
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,080
 freedom.

1802
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:43,790
 Well,

1803
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:44,790
 Mr.

1804
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:46,750
 Huxel,

1805
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:47,000
 take

1806
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:47,500
 a

1807
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:47,990
 look again at the country,

1808
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:48,100
 which is in the stance

1809
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:48,990
 of

1810
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:49,120
 our opponent

1811
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:49,490
 any way it

1812
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:49,970
 would seem

1813
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:49,990
 to be

1814
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:50,990
 there.

1815
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:51,500
 Soviet

1816
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,060
 Russia.

1817
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:52,400
 It

1818
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,000
 is

1819
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:55,650
 strong and

1820
00:24:55,650 --> 00:24:56,150
 getting stronger,

1821
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:56,470
 economically,

1822
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:57,150
 militarily. At

1823
00:24:57,150 --> 00:24:57,650
 the same

1824
00:24:57,650 --> 00:24:58,150
 time,

1825
00:24:58,150 --> 00:24:59,480
 it's

1826
00:24:59,480 --> 00:24:59,500
 developing

1827
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,000
 its

1828
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:00,060
 art

1829
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:00,240
 forms

1830
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,380
 pretty

1831
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:03,000
 well.

1832
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,660
 It

1833
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:06,600
 seems not

1834
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,660
 unnecessarily to squelch the creative urge

1835
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:08,500
 among its

1836
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:08,750
 people,

1837
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:09,000
 and yet

1838
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:09,100
 it

1839
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:09,130
 is not a free

1840
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:11,940
 society.

1841
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 It

1842
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:15,890
 is not

1843
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:16,040
 a

1844
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:16,550
 free

1845
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:19,620
 society, but

1846
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:20,120
 here

1847
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:20,220
 is something very

1848
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:20,520
 interesting

1849
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:20,620
 that

1850
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:21,120
 those

1851
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:21,610
 members

1852
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:21,620
 of

1853
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:22,120
 the society, like

1854
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:22,620
 the scientists who are doing

1855
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:23,120
 the creative work,

1856
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:23,620
 are given far more

1857
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:24,620
 freedom

1858
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:24,750
 than

1859
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:25,400
 anybody else.

1860
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:26,520
 I

1861
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:29,520
 mean,

1862
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,420
 it's

1863
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:32,520
 a privileged aristocratic

1864
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:32,760
 society

1865
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:33,020
 in which provided that they

1866
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:33,270
 don't poke

1867
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:34,750
 their

1868
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:36,270
 noses into political affairs,

1869
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:36,770
 these people are given a great deal of prestige, a considerable amount of freedom, and a lot

1870
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:39,770
 of

1871
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:40,270
 money.

1872
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:41,500
 I

1873
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,000
 mean,

1874
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:42,500
 this is a very interesting

1875
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,500
 fact about

1876
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:44,630
 the new

1877
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:45,500
 Soviet

1878
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:46,000
 regime.

1879
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:47,890
 And

1880
00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:53,890
 I

1881
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:53,990
 think

1882
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:55,260
 we're going to see people on the whole with very little freedom, but with an oligarchy

1883
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:57,370
 on top, enjoying considerable measure of

1884
00:25:57,370 --> 00:25:57,870
 freedom and a very

1885
00:25:57,870 --> 00:25:58,370
 high standard of

1886
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:02,370
 living.

1887
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:03,380
 And the people

1888
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:05,380
 down below, the

1889
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:06,160
 epsilons

1890
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:06,660
 down

1891
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:07,130
 below,

1892
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:07,180
 enjoying

1893
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:07,370
 very

1894
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:07,630
 little.

1895
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,300
 And you think that that

1896
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:08,600
 kind

1897
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:08,800
 of

1898
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,270
 situation can long endure?

1899
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 I

1900
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:13,340
 think it can certainly endure much

1901
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:13,680
 longer

1902
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:16,000
 than the

1903
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:16,060
 situation in which everybody is kept

1904
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:17,820
 down.

1905
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 I mean,

1906
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:19,500
 they

1907
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:19,540
 can certainly get

1908
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:20,000
 their

1909
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:20,060
 technological and scientific

1910
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:20,300
 results

1911
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:20,740
 on

1912
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:21,040
 such a

1913
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,250
 basis.

1914
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 Well,

1915
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 the

1916
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:26,240
 next

1917
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:26,980
 time that

1918
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:27,160
 I

1919
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:30,900
 talk to

1920
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:31,070
 you

1921
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:31,280
 then,

1922
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:31,400
 perhaps

1923
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:31,500
 we

1924
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:31,760
 should

1925
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:31,820
 investigate

1926
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:32,140
 further

1927
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:32,400
 the

1928
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:32,500
 possibility

1929
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,000
 of

1930
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:33,240
 establishment

1931
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:33,400
 of

1932
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:33,480
 that

1933
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:33,500
 kind of

1934
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:33,900
 a

1935
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:34,000
 society,

1936
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:34,250
 where

1937
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:34,480
 the

1938
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:34,500
 drones

1939
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:35,000
 work for

1940
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:35,540
 the

1941
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:36,040
 Queen

1942
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:36,540
 bees

1943
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:37,000
 up

1944
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:37,500
 above.

1945
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:38,750
 Well,

1946
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:42,860
 with

1947
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:44,530
 years,

1948
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:45,400
 but

1949
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:45,500
 I

1950
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:45,920
 must say, I

1951
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:45,940
 still believe

1952
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:46,500
 in democracy if

1953
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:46,900
 we

1954
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:47,000
 can make the

1955
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:47,500
 best of all

1956
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:48,000
 the creative activities of the people on top, plus those of the people on the bottom so much the

1957
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 better.

1958
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:53,180
 Mr.

1959
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:54,950
 Huxley, I surely

1960
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:55,150
 thank you for spending this half

1961
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:55,190
 hour with

1962
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:55,380
 us, and I

1963
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:55,430
 wish

1964
00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:55,520
 you God's

1965
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,960
 speed,

1966
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:57,980
 sir.

1967
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:58,750
 Thank

1968
00:26:58,750 --> 00:26:59,250
 you.

1969
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:00,050
 All

1970
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:00,250
 this

1971
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:00,940
 Huxley finds

1972
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:03,510
 himself

1973
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:05,730
 these days

1974
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:06,010
 in a peculiar and disturbing position, a quarter

1975
00:27:06,010 --> 00:27:06,500
 of a century after prophesying an authoritarian state in which people were reduced to

1976
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:12,800
 Cyprus.

1977
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:13,100
 He

1978
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:13,200
 can

1979
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:13,600
 point at Soviet

1980
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,230
 Russia

1981
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:14,500
 and

1982
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:14,540
 say, I told you

1983
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:15,240
 so.

1984
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:16,500
 The

1985
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:17,680
 crucial question, as

1986
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:17,970
 he sees it

1987
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:18,000
 now,

1988
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 is whether the so-called free

1989
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,940
 world is shortly going to give Mr. Huxley the further dubious satisfaction of

1990
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:23,000
 saying the same thing

1991
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:23,500
 about

1992
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:28,000
 us.

1993
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:29,760
 Stay

1994
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,260
 tuned for a preview of next week's interview.

1995
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:31,760
 Till then, my

1996
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,500
 qualis. Good

1997
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:34,060
 night.
